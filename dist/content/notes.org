* Notes
This is stuff that didn't quite fit into any of the parts and would
probably be better off somewhere else

** From Part 1
*** How is this code set up?

Excellent question. For the entirety of Lesson 1, you will be dealing
with the textual form of assembly code. We think it's important that
you understand the high level overview of emulation before diving into
the nitty gritty of how things really work under the hood.

** From Part 5
*** The Branch Delay Slot

The branch delay slot refers the the fact that an instruction
immediately after a branch instruction is always executed. What that
means for this lesson is that whenever you see a branch instruction,
you must execute the instruction immediately following it before
taking the branch (or even if you don't take the branch)
