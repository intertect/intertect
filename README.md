## Directory Structure

- `public/` contains the static files that make up the webpage. This is the only directory needed to serve the project (in its current state). For now, this is where all development on the site happens
- `config/` contains all the relevant configuration files for the project
- `scripts/` contains any handy-dandy scripts we write
- In the future there will be one more directory that contains the templates used to generate the site
