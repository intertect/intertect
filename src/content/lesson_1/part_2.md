# Part 2: Headed Off On Your Own

In this lesson, you'll be implementing the `subu` instruction.  Over the course
of these lessons you'll be adding to your code over so by the end you'll have a
complete emulator.

## Your Task
Your task this time is to implement the `subu` instruction.  As a reminder, you
can click on any instruction on the sidebar to be taken to a glossary containing
all the information you could possibly want to know about it.

## Where Is The Rest Of The Long-Winded Introduction?
There isn't any! You don't have any excuses now. `subu` is just like `addu` but
with subtraction instead of addition.  However, if you really would like to read
more, go back to the previous lesson and replace every instance of `addu` with
`subu` in the last section.
